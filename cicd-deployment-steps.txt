what would my ideal CICD pipeline would look like for this project: 

Trigger => on push / merge 

Build => from the Dockerfile, with a clean environment with an available runner (Gitlab CI for example)
apply image tags 

Test => unitary & integration tests to validate
security tests (with Trivy for example)

Deliver => code & images are pushed to the repository (example private Docker Hub)

Deploy => if there is a stagging environment, deploy the images & the code into the stagging env
change images tags, ask for a manual review 
when accepted, do the same in the production env with a rolling update if possible

Monitor => During tests, send notifications for status changes (email or dedicated channels or other). After test, create / update monitoring boards and focus on the impact on production
